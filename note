Here are **7 progressive prompts** for the task, starting with a non-code-generating prompt and progressively building towards more detailed coding assistance:

---

### **Prompt 1 (Non-Code-Generating)**
**Topic:** Understanding PyTest and CI/CD Integration
- Explain the benefits of integrating the PyTest framework into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
- Discuss how this approach ensures code quality and stability in large-scale web application development.
- Provide examples of popular CI/CD tools that can integrate with PyTest.

---

### **Prompt 2**
**Topic:** Setting up a PyTest Test Suite
- Provide an example of setting up a basic PyTest test suite for a Python web application.
- Include a test case that validates a function (e.g., a function that calculates discounts for an e-commerce app).
- Explain how the test cases can be written to assert the expected outcomes of the function.

---

### **Prompt 3**
**Topic:** Configuring PyTest for CI/CD
- Show how to structure a Python project for seamless integration with a CI/CD pipeline using PyTest.
- Explain how to add a `pytest.ini` configuration file for controlling test behavior (e.g., setting log levels or adding markers).
- Highlight how to exclude specific tests from the CI/CD pipeline using markers or configuration options.

---

### **Prompt 4**
**Topic:** Integrating PyTest with GitHub Actions
- Demonstrate how to integrate PyTest into a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Provide an example of a YAML configuration file to automatically run PyTest whenever a commit is pushed to the repository.
- Include steps to fail the pipeline if any test fails and notify the developers.

---

### **Prompt 5**
**Topic:** Adding Coverage Reporting to PyTest in CI/CD
- Show how to enhance PyTest in the pipeline by adding code coverage reporting using the `pytest-cov` plugin.
- Explain how to configure the pipeline to generate a coverage report and fail if the coverage falls below a threshold (e.g., 80%).
- Provide an example of a modified CI/CD YAML configuration file for this purpose.

---

### **Prompt 6**
**Topic:** Parallelizing Tests in PyTest for CI/CD Efficiency
- Explain how to optimize CI/CD pipelines by running PyTest test cases in parallel.
- Provide an example using the `pytest-xdist` plugin for parallel execution.
- Demonstrate how to adjust the CI/CD pipeline configuration to utilize multiple CPU cores during the testing phase.

---

### **Prompt 7**
**Topic:** Debugging Failed Tests in CI/CD Pipelines
- Describe how developers can debug failed PyTest tests in a CI/CD pipeline.
- Provide an example of capturing detailed logs and artifacts (e.g., test reports or logs) during pipeline execution.
- Explain how to use pipeline tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI to re-run specific failing tests.

This progression begins with a conceptual understanding and gradually dives into practical code and CI/CD pipeline configurations, offering a complete learning path for the topic.
