Here are **7 progressive prompts** for integrating Python's PyTest framework into a CI/CD pipeline based on your Django e-commerce app. The first prompt has **5 constraints**, while subsequent prompts have **4 constraints** each.

---

### **Prompt 1 (5 Constraints): Basic Setup for PyTest Integration**
1. Set up PyTest for the Django project, ensuring it can discover and run tests in the applicationâ€™s `tests` directory.
2. Create a basic test suite for the `Category` model, verifying CRUD operations.
3. Configure a `pytest.ini` file to specify settings such as test discovery paths and markers.
4. Use the Django test database to isolate tests from production data.
5. Add initial tests to validate the API endpoints for `Category` (e.g., ensuring `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` work correctly).

---

### **Prompt 2 (4 Constraints): Writing Tests for the Product Model**
1. Develop a test suite for the `Product` model, verifying CRUD operations and relationships with the `Category` model.
2. Write tests for the `Product` API endpoints, including filtering by `name`, `description`, and ordering by `price`.
3. Mock file uploads for the `image` field in `Product` to ensure compatibility during testing.
4. Ensure test coverage is tracked for the `Product` model and its associated API endpoints.

---

### **Prompt 3 (4 Constraints): Testing User Authentication**
1. Add tests for user authentication, ensuring proper access control to the API endpoints (e.g., unauthenticated users cannot create or update resources).
2. Test token-based authentication (if enabled) to ensure valid tokens are required to access protected endpoints.
3. Verify the behavior of permissions, particularly the `IsAdminUserOrReadOnly` permission for the `Order` API.
4. Simulate different user roles (e.g., `admin`, `guest`) in tests to validate role-specific API behavior.

---

### **Prompt 4 (4 Constraints): Order Model and API Testing**
1. Write a test suite for the `Order` model, focusing on the many-to-many relationship with `Product`.
2. Add tests for the `Order` API endpoints, ensuring accurate calculations of `total_price` during order creation.
3. Validate search and filtering functionality for `Order` API, such as filtering orders by `user` or `product`.
4. Test the behavior of the `perform_create` method in `OrderViewSet` to ensure it correctly assigns the `created_by` user.

---

### **Prompt 5 (4 Constraints): Advanced PyTest Features**
1. Use PyTest fixtures to set up reusable test data (e.g., pre-populated `Category`, `Product`, and `Order` instances).
2. Parametrize tests to validate different combinations of input data for the API endpoints.
3. Introduce marks to classify tests (e.g., `@pytest.mark.slow` for tests that involve multiple database operations).
4. Enable parallel test execution with `pytest-xdist` to speed up test runs.

---

### **Prompt 6 (4 Constraints): Integration with CI/CD Pipeline**
1. Configure a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run PyTest whenever code is pushed or a pull request is created.
2. Ensure the pipeline uses a separate test database and correctly migrates schemas before running tests.
3. Fail the CI pipeline if any test fails, and output detailed error logs for debugging.
4. Add a step in the CI pipeline to generate a test coverage report and upload it as an artifact.

---

### **Prompt 7 (4 Constraints): Optimizing and Scaling Testing**
1. Integrate PyTest with tools like `pytest-django` to simplify Django-specific testing needs.
2. Use tools like `pytest-cov` to enforce minimum coverage thresholds in the CI pipeline.
3. Split the test suite into smaller groups (e.g., unit tests, integration tests) for more targeted CI workflows.
4. Schedule periodic full test runs (e.g., nightly) to identify long-term regressions in the codebase.

These prompts progressively address the integration of PyTest in a Django e-commerce application, covering model testing, API validation, advanced PyTest features, and CI/CD pipeline integration.
